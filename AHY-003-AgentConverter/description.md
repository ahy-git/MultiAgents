This crew automatically converts Python scripts that use direct LLM calls into modular, production-ready CrewAI agents by analyzing the code and restructuring it into agents, tasks, and tools. It reads source files and output examples, identifies LLM usage, and rewrites the logic using CrewAI conventionsâ€”outputting clean, structured code blocks where each tool is implemented in a separate. This enables fast, standardized migration from prototype scripts to scalable multi-agent systems.
