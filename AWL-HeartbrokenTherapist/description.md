The BreakupRecoveryCrew is a modular CrewAI agent system designed to help users emotionally recover from breakups. It includes four specialized agents: an empathetic therapist for emotional validation, a closure expert for unsent messages and healing rituals, a planner for a 7-day recovery routine, and a brutally honest advisor that offers raw, fact-based insights using web search. Built with LLM orchestration and optional image input support, this crew provides structured, multi-perspective guidance to navigate emotional distress.
