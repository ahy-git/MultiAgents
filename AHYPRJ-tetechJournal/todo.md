        1. Deep-Research
        Overview:
        Deep-Research is an iterative research agent that autonomously generates search queries, scrapes websites, and processes information using AI reasoning models. It aims to provide a structured approach to deep research tasks.

        Key Features:
        Query Generation: Dynamically generates optimized search queries.
        Web Scraping with Firecrawl: Extracts useful information from websites.
        o3-Mini Model for Reasoning: Uses OpenAI’s o3-mini model for intelligent processing.
        100% Open Source: Fully accessible and modifiable.
        GitHub Repository:
        https://github.com/dzhng/deep-research

        2. OpenDeepResearcher
        Overview:
        OpenDeepResearcher is an asynchronous AI research agent designed to conduct comprehensive research iteratively. It utilizes multiple search engines, content extraction tools, and LLM APIs to provide detailed insights.

        Key Features:
        SERP API Integration: Automates iterative search queries.
        Jina AI for Content Extraction: Extracts and summarizes webpage content.
        OpenRouter LLM Processing: Utilizes various open LLMs for reasoning.
        100% Open Source: Offers flexibility in customization and deployment.
        GitHub Repository: 
        https://github.com/mshumer/OpenDeepResearcher

        3. Open Deep Research by Firecrawl
        Overview:
        Open Deep Research is a lightweight and efficient AI research agent that leverages Firecrawl search and extraction mechanisms. It allows users to reason with any LLM of their choice rather than relying on a fine-tuned proprietary model.

        Key Features:
        Firecrawl Search + Extract: Fetches and extracts relevant content efficiently.
        Customizable AI Reasoning: Supports any LLM via the AI SDK.
        Open Source & Self-Hostable: Full control over deployment and customization.
        GitHub Repository:
        https://github.com/nickscamara/open-deep-research

        4. DeepResearch by Jina AI
        Overview:
        DeepResearch by Jina AI is an advanced AI research assistant that replicates OpenAI’s agentic search, read, and reasoning workflow. It integrates multiple search engines and employs an AI-driven approach to extract and summarize relevant information.

        Key Features:
        Search Integration: Uses Gemini Flash, Brave, and DuckDuckGo for diverse search results.
        AI-Powered Reading: Implements Jina Reader to extract and summarize content efficiently.
        Reasoning Process: Uses advanced AI models for contextual understanding.
        100% Open Source: Fully customizable and self-hostable.
        GitHub Repository: 
        https://github.com/jina-ai/node-DeepResearch

        Conclusion
        These four open-source AI research agents provide powerful alternatives to OpenAI’s Deep Research AI Agent. With robust search capabilities, AI-powered extraction, and reasoning features, they enable researchers to automate and optimize their workflows without incurring high costs. Since all options are open-source, users have complete flexibility to modify, extend, and self-host these tools based on their specific needs.
