This module provides a lightweight data analytics agent system using CrewAI, featuring two tools: PandasTools for in-memory DataFrame operations via natural language, and DuckDBQueryTool for executing SQL queries on CSV files using DuckDB. The DataQueryCrew class orchestrates the process, enabling an LLM-powered agent to analyze uploaded tabular data, generate insights, and return results through either SQL or pandas-based logicâ€”ideal for automating business intelligence queries without requiring a database backend or manual coding.
