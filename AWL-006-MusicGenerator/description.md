This CrewAI system automates the generation of music from natural language prompts by orchestrating an agent equipped with the ModelsLab API. It receives detailed prompts describing genre, style, and instrumentation, then composes and returns a downloadable MP3 link. Designed for modularity and reuse, the crew encapsulates LLM-driven creativity in a structured agent-task workflow ideal for dynamic music generation.
