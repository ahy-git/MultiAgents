The section evaluates the performance of generative agents in predicting human responses. The objective is to compare the predictive accuracy of interview-based, demographic-based, and persona-based agents across three different tasks: the General Social Survey (GSS), Big Five personality traits (BFI-44), and economic games. The GSS evaluation used 177 core questions. The Big Five assessment used the BFI-44 questionnaire. Economic games involved real monetary incentives. The primary finding is that interview-based generative agents consistently outperformed both demographic-based and persona-based agents in all three evaluation components. For instance, in the GSS, interview-based agents achieved a normalized accuracy of 0.85, significantly higher than the others. The statistical analyses, including ANOVA and post-hoc tests, confirmed these significant differences. A representative quote is not possible without the section text.
