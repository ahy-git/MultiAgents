The data collection process involved a custom-built platform where participants signed up. It comprised two phases. Phase one included informed consent, creation of a 2-D sprite avatar, a two-hour interview with an AI interviewer, and completion of surveys and experiments in a set order: General Social Survey (GSS), Big Five Inventory (BFI-44), economic games, and behavioral experiments. The order of sub-components within the games, replication studies, and BFI-44 questions was randomized. Phase two, a follow-up study two weeks later, repeated the surveys and experiments, excluding the interview, to assess response consistency.
