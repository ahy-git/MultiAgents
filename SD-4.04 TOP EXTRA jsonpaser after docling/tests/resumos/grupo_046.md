Here's the summary:

This section, encompassing Trechos 209, 210, and 211, focuses on industrial wastewater treatment within the food industry.

*   **Trecho 209:** Examines the technical and economic feasibility of various treatment alternatives. Key topics include effluent characterization, technology selection, system dimensioning, cost-benefit analysis, and environmental impact assessment. It considers various food industry effluents and technologies like physical-chemical, biological, and tertiary treatments. The economic assessment covers investment, operation, and maintenance costs. Environmental impact focuses on reducing organic load, removing nutrients, and managing waste. "A seleção da tecnologia mais adequada dependerá das características específicas do efluente e dos requisitos de qualidade da água a ser descartada."
*   **Trecho 210:** Details the industrial effluent characterization process. The main topics include effluent collection and sampling, physicochemical and microbiological analyses, and flow rate determination. Relevant information includes sample collection and preservation methods, analytical parameters and methods, and the importance of flow rate for system dimensioning. "A correta caracterização dos efluentes é fundamental para o sucesso do tratamento."
*   **Trecho 211:** Addresses the cost-benefit analysis of different treatment alternatives. Key aspects are investment costs, operational costs, revenues, sensitivity analysis, and payback assessment. Relevant information includes cost and revenue calculation methods, sensitivity analysis to assess cost and revenue variations, and payback period evaluation. "A análise econômica deve considerar o ciclo de vida do sistema de tratamento."
