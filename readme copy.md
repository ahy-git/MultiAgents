# üß† MultiAgents

**MultiAgents** is a library of autonomous agents designed for automation, experimentation, and task orchestration using LLMs (e.g., CrewAI, Guardrails, custom tools). It includes a wide variety of agents covering tasks like content generation, project planning, PDF handling, streamlit UIs, API integration, database interaction, and more.

## üìå Notes

* Some folders like `2.08` and `2.09` are experimental or broken.
* Agents are designed to be standalone ‚Äì most can be run via `python main.py` in their folder.
* Designed for rapid prototyping of LLM-based systems and agentic flows.
