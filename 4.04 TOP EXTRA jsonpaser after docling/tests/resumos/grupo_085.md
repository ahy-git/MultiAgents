Exploratory Robustness Analysis Results: This section presents supplementary findings from the exploratory robustness analysis (Study 3), examining the performance of different agent types based on the materials used to inform their behavior.

Main topics include:
- Performance comparison of agents informed by surveys and experiments, maximal agents, summary agents, and random lesion interview agents.
- Analysis of demographic bias in agent predictions.

Relevant information:
- Interview-based agents consistently outperformed survey and experiment-based agents in predicting GSS responses, with a normalized accuracy of 0.85 versus 0.76.
- Maximal agents, incorporating data from surveys, experiments, and interviews, showed similar performance to interview-based agents.
- Performance declined linearly when portions of the interview data were removed, demonstrating the value of interview data.
- Significant demographic performance discrepancies were rare, but notable exceptions arose in predicting GSS responses based on political ideology, party affiliation, and sexual orientation.

Representative direct quote: "Specifically, predictive performance was noticeably stronger for participants identifying as strong liberals, strong Democrats, and non-heterosexual/straight, compared to those identifying as more conservative, Republican, or heterosexual/straight."
