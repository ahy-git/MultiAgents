Objective: The section aims to evaluate the predictive accuracy of generative agents regarding attitudes and behaviors using surveys and experimental constructs.

Main Topics:
*   General Social Survey (GSS)
*   Big Five Personality Traits
*   Authoritarianism
*   Political Ideology

Relevant Information:
*   The study identifies four existing constructs commonly used in social sciences to assess the agents' predictive capabilities.
*   The GSS, a sociological survey, is used to collect data on demographics and viewpoints, focusing on structured response questions.
*   Big Five personality traits, a framework in psychology, are assessed using the BFI-50 questionnaire.
*   Authoritarianism, a construct describing beliefs prioritizing obedience to authority, is measured using a custom scale derived from existing measures.
*   Political Ideology, concerning beliefs about government and society, is assessed through a self-report scale.
