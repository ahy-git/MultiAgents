Survey and Experiment Agents. To investigate whether interviews are a uniquely powerful medium or if similar information can be captured through surveys and

experiments, we created composite descriptions by compiling participants' responses to all three components used in our study-the GSS, Big Five personality test, and economic games. This approach aligns with traditional social science methods, which have developed and validated surveys and experiments to efficiently gain maximal information from participants. We aimed to determine if these established methods

capture comparable information to our interview-based agents. In other words, do the interviews capture the same predictive power, more, or less, than these common validated
